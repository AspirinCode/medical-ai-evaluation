interpretation. identification of suspected findings is not for diagnostic use beyond notification. specifically, the device analyzes ct angiogram images of the brain acquired in the acute setting, and sends notifications to a neurovascular specialist that a suspected large vessel occlusion has been identified and recommends review of those images. images can be previewed through a mobile application.","3":"Idx-dr is indicated for use by health care providers to automatically detect more than mild diabetic retinopathy (mtmdr) in adults diagnosed with diabetes who have not been
